# My Algorithm Learning and Practicing Notes

This repo started when I was following the video tutorials 
https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV13g41157hK.

And now I want to repurpose it as the one place I put the notes and code for the algorithms I know.

I'd like to systematically go through the topics on https://oi-wiki.org/ at my pace.  
I'd strengthen my understanding by writing notes, and trying to visualize them using `manim`: 3B1B's animation engine.
(takes a lot of work though)  
There'll also be LeetCode.
